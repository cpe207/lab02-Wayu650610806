            The picture of my first cat. She had been with me for 8 years. She
            loved to sleep with me every night. She loved to lay on my desk
            while I was studying. I loved her.

            The Rujiwong pool in Chiang mai university. It's very good place for
            swimming. It's free for CMU students but I don't know why it's alway
            empty when I go there!

            This is my dorm where I live. I don't like it becuase it's very
            small and It's not personal place becuase I have 2 roommates. But I
            love the view of this dorm.It's very beautiful.
